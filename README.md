# What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is the work of making sense out of visual, audio, or other data inputs for machines. So far with computer vision, we are able to recognise faces, read licence plates, find objects in a given image, summarise the content of a photo, and a lot more.

At first computer vision started quite manually, with researchers trying to come up with to detect certain patterns and images, but with the surge of deep learning, over the last decade, we now have models that can automatically learn these patterns just by looking at the examples.

> “Computer vision is a field of study which enables computers to replicate the human visual system. It’s a subset of artificial intelligence which collects information from digital images or videos and processes them to define the attributes. The entire process involves image acquiring, screening, analysing, identifying and extracting information. This extensive processing helps computers to understand any visual content and act on it accordingly. You can also take up a computer vision course for free to understand the basics under Artificial intelligence domain.” (M.

Computer vision is a branch of computer science that powers machines to see, recognise, and process images. It is a multi-disciplinary field, and is a subfield of artificial intelligence and machine learning. 


# How does Computer Vision Work?

👁️ Computer vision primarily uses pattern recognition techniques to self-train and understand data.

Computer vision algorithms are trained by using a lot of visual data. The model process these images and finds patterns. “For example, If we send a million pictures of vegetable images to a model to train, it will analyse them and create an Engine (Computer Vision Model) based on patterns that are similar to all vegetables. As a result, Our Model will be able to accurately detect whether a particular image is a Vegetables every time we send it.” (Dharmaraj, Mar. 2022).

> ”While machine learning algorithms were previously used for computer vision applications, now deep learning methods have evolved as a better solution for this domain. For instance, machine learning techniques require a humongous amount of data and active human monitoring in the initial phase monitoring to ensure that the results are as accurate as possible. Deep learning on the other hand, relies on neural networks, and uses examples for problem solving. It self-learns by using labeled data to recognise common patterns in the examples.” (M.
